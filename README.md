## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
When you first open the exe, you'll get a message saying to install .NET 5 Runtime if you don't already have it installed. Please do so if that's the case.

### Setup
Next thing you want to do is choose the game that you wish to mod from the dropdown menu, then click the Setup button.  From there you would just have to select the specific game exe that it's asking for.  Once you do that, Unverum will handle the rest and let you know when setup is completed.

### Installing Mods
Before you can manage and load some mods, you have to install some.

There are 3 methods of doing this:
1. Using the built in Mod Browser tab to download mods found on GameBanana
2. Using 1-click install buttons (once they're added in) from browsing mods directly from the GameBanana website
3. Downloading mods from other websites such as Nexus or VideoGameMods and extracting them straight into your mods folder which you can access by pressing the Open Mods Folder button

### Managing Mods
Managing mods is as simple as dragging the order of the rows to prioritize the top and enabling which mods you want in the build. Once you have your desired loadout, make sure to click the Build button. After building is completed, you can finally press Launch.

### Auto Updates
Unverum also supports auto updates for mods downloaded from GameBanana using the built-in browser or the 1-click install buttons. Click the Check for Updates button for Unverum to check if any are available for the currently selected game.

Self updates for Unverum are also supported so you don't need to keep checking back here to see if you have the latest version. These are checked everytime on launch.
